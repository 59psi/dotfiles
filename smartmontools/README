smartctl and smartd configuration files.

com.jfnagel.smartctl.plist

This file is placed in /Library/LaunchAgents and is sudo'd into launchd via launchctl. It needs to be chown'd to root. It runs '/usr/local/bin/smartctl --smart=on --saveauto=on' to ensure that SMART operations are enabled at startup (OS X turns them off by default). 

com.jfnagel.smartd.plist

This file is placed in /Library/LaunchDaemons and is sudo'd into launchd via launchctl. It needs to be chown'd to root. It runs '/usr/local/bin/smartd -n' at startup. the -n flag is required to prevent smartd from forking and killing it's parent process, which launchd doesn't handle well (it just starts smartd again).

smartd.conf

Configuration file for smartd.conf. The current scan is:

/dev/disk0s2 -a -S on -s (S/../.././02|L/../../6/03) -m jacknagel@gmail.com
